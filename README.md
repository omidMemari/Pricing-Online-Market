Pricing Online Market Using Data Mining Techniques

In this project, we did a task in Data Mining Cup 2012. Train dataset included price and number of objects have sold for each day with a certain price. By changing the price for each
day, number of objects that sold have changed. Train dataset included these data for 6 weeks and our goal was to predict number of sales for each object with given price for two another
weeks. We noticed that dataset had some outlier data and in order to achieve good results we removed them. Then we use Linear Regression for prediction.
